## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.7] 2021-04-29

### Fixed

- Files configured to use the CacheOnly strategy will no longer we using the CacheFirst strategy (thanks a lot for spotting this bug [@JoeTodes](https://github.com/JoeTodes)!)

## [0.2.6] 2020-08-18

### Fixed

- Bug when the scope would not be suffixed by a slash, causing the service worker to still not have the good scope to run correctly.

## [0.2.5] 2020-08-17

### Fixed

- The service worker scope will be suffixed by a slash correctly when using pathPrefix gridsome.config.js option.

## [0.2.4] 2020-08-17

### Fixed

- Bug when the service worker would produce a error instead of working correctly.

## [0.2.3] 2020-08-16

### Fixed

- The service worker registration path will correctly use your `pathPrefix` from `gridsome.config.js`, instead of just for the scope.

## [0.2.2] 2020-08-16

### Fixed

- The scope of the service worker will correctly use your `pathPrefix` in order for the service worker to load correctly.

## [0.2.1] 2020-08-16

### Fixed

- Your `pathPrefix` options in `gridsome.config.js` will now be taken into account (previously, specifying this options would be ignored, so the path to the service worker registration file would ignore it, causing the service worker to not load at all).

## [0.2.0] 2020-08-16

### Added

- Support for caching files based on their type (html, scripts, styles, ...). Check the documentation for more information.

## [0.1.5] 2020-05-01

### Added

- Supporting more browsers (95% coverage at this time).

### Fixed

- Out of date dependencies.

## [0.1.4] 2020-01-11

### Fixed

- Bug when a dependency that was used to validate the option was generating an error when building the project on Netlify.

## [0.1.3] 2020-01-05

### Fixed

- Bug when new installations would see their service worker not working because the service worker registration file would not have been copied to the static folder.

## [0.1.2] 2020-01-03

### Fixed

- The service worker registration file was previously compiled each time you would build your project. Now it is compiled by default, and will be used compiled instead (which improved the speed of this plugin by aproximatively 25% in my computer).
- Previously, you could potentially catch the service worker registration file within one of your network strategies if you specified a regular expression to catch it (for example, using `/\.js$/` to catch all the Javascript files would also catch this service worker registration file). This could potentially be fatal if you used a cacheFirst strategy as this would mean this file could never change. Now, the generated service worker registration file (`/assets/js/service-worker.js`) will not be catched by any of your network strategies anymore.

## [0.1.1] 2019-12-28

### Fixed

- Bug when installing the library from NPM, and building a project after configuring this library would make the plugin to request missing files. The missing files have been added.

## [0.1.0] 2019-12-28

### Added

- First working version. You can configure this plugin to fetch your route using these network strategies: - Cache-first (behind the `cacheFirst` option) - Cache-only (behind the `cacheOnly` option) - Network-first (behind the `networkFirst` option) - Network-only (behind the `networkOnly` option) - Stale while revalidate (behind the `staleWhileRevalidate` option)
- You can add routes to precache ahead of time (right after the service worker installed) using the `precachedRoutes` option.
